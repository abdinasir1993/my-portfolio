# marketing-agency-refractor-project

what i was tasked to do on this project was the following:

- Make it accessible
- Possibly refactor CSS code
- Use semantic HTML elements where possible
- Include comments
- Make sure the page has a logical structure (title, header, body, footer)
- There should be a logical order to headings (h1->h6)
- Ensure there are alt attributes for all images and keep it descriptive
- Document title (head element) should be descriptive
- Search Engine Optimisation nav link is broken (fix it)
- Remove duplicate class names in CSS and replace with generic class name in HTMl

## My process

1.  images was missing descriptive alt tags which i ammended
2.  i have added samentic htmls elements instead of certain divs. i have added a header, nave, section, aside and a footer.
3.  CHANGED THE TITLE TO MAKE IT MORE DESCRIPTIVE
4.  included an id tag to make the link accessible for the "online-reputation -management"
5.  i have edited the previous classes on css to update to correct layout. i have edited it to nav, nav ul and nav ul li. this has resulted in the bar nav error to be corrected from the previous classes.
6.  - i have changed the repeating codes on css to one code. for benefits- lead, benefit-brands and benefit-code to just benefits. including the h3 and images because the code was being repeated on all where one sufficed.
    - search engine optimaization, online-reputation-management and social-media-marketing all shared the same rules, so i put it all in the content class within section.
    - i have changed all the rules on img and h2 to .content h2 and content imge
    - after running through some error returned search engine optimaization, online-reputation-management and social-media-marketing to original code on css.
    - created new class which is shared between search engine optimaization, online-reputation-management and social-media-marketing called content3. reduced and amended the class in css to just that one.
